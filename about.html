<h1>Training</h1>

<article>
    ERC caters for people of all ages and abilities and each group trains multiple times a week. Don't worry if you can't attend every session, so long as you have fun while exercising any time you are down with us! We train all year round and training is only ever cancelled in extreme circumstances and bank holidays.<br><br>*Note* We understand a lot of our underage members may train with their respective schools' Cross Country team. We fully understand this and do not expect all sessions with the club and the school to be attended.<br><h2>Seniors (18+)</h2>Senior training is three times a week - Mondays, Thursdays and Sundays. On Mondays, we train from 18:15 to 19:30. We either do a speed session or a workout on the hills. Thursdays is  from 18:30 to 19:30 and is usually interval training, this will either be 800m, 1000m or 1200m reps. Sunday training (which is optional) is a long slow run. Times can vary for what time we meet, but it is usually 09:30. Sometimes members run out to neighbouring towns Lisbellaw and Maguiresbridge or just around town - it just depends on the time year as members may be training for a (half) marathon. All sessions begin and end at the Lakeland Forum. If you are a new runner but would like build up some base fitness we have a biannual Couch to 5K  programme, with the second of which running in line with our yearly race - Enniskillen Spooktacular. You can find out more about the race <a href="spooktacular.html">here.</a><br><h2>Juniors (Secondary School Kids)</h2>Junior training is three times a week too. We train on Tuesday, Thursday and Sundays. The training involved is similar to that of the seniors. Tuedays meetings are from 18:30 to 19:30 where members do speed work. Thursday meetings are also from 18:30 to 19:30 and usually entails an easy run around the town. Tuesday and Thursday sessions are at the Lakeland Forum. Sundays involve Cross Country training at Necarne from 09:30 to 10:30.<br><h2>Minis (Primary School Kids)</h2>Minis train once a week on a Friday night from 17:45 to 18:30 at the Lakeland Forum. It usually is just a workout capable for all the kids to do.
